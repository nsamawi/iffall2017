		<h2>Feedback for Monica</h2>
		<h3>Aesthetic</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Striking, nice contrast, relates well to the concept</li>
			<li>Aesthetic is consistent and imagery makes sense with the quote</li>
			<li>Maybe consider different typefaces - this one feels like a default font.</li>
			<li>Quotation marks are inconsistent
		</ul>
		<h3>Structure</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Images seem to be the priority so the quote feels less important - if you want the quote to stand out more try changing the typeface, making it bold, etc.
			</li>
			<li>Some design elements are working well together, like the MadMen in the first design</li>
			<li>How will you deal with the collapsing space in the third design?</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Images seem to be a good resolution</li>
			<li>Negative space in top of first design?</li>
