		<h2>Neema Samawi</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>I hope to learn how to use HTML to create an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing website of my own, as well as potentially designing websites for others whose mission and message I want to promote.</li>
			<li>I expect that designing for screens will be different because of the added technical aspect of writing code and because of the need to consider interactiveness and user-friendliness in the design process.</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.cocooncooks.com/">This website</a> exemplifies effective design.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple's website</a> is an example of effective communication.</li>
			<li><a href="https://thrivemarket.com">This website</a> both exemplifies design that both works well and communicates effectively.</li>
